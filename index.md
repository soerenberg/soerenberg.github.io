I currently work as a data scientist at Fit Analytics, a Berlin-based e-commerce company and one of the world's leading companies to provide online sizing recommendations in fashion.



My Ph.D. is in mathematics. You can find more on my past publications and academic work <a href="academia.html">here.</a>



Besides machine learning in general I am particularly interested in the following topics

* Bayesian inference,
* information theory,
* high-dimensional probability,
* functional programming.


These days I primarily write code in **Python** but also have substantial experience in 

* R,
* SQL,
* C / C++,
* Haskell.

Moreover, I used Matlab, Perl, and Mathematica in the past.


My academic work was based on Geometry the Numbers (basically the intersection of number theory and geometry) and Additive Combinatorics.
