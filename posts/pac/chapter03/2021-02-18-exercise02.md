# Exercise 3.2

Let $X$ be a number chosen uniformly at random from $[-k,k]$. Find $Var[X]$.

**Solution:** If we shifted $X$ by $k+1$, we would get the uniform distribution over $[1,2k+1]$. Therefore, by exercise 3.1 we have

$$
\mathrm{Var}[X] = \frac{(2k+1)^2 - 1}{12} = \frac{4k^2 + 4k}{12} = \frac{k^2+k}{3}.
$$

In particular, for $k=29$ we get $\mathrm{Var}[X] = 290$.

We verify this by simple sampling.


```python
num_samples = 10**7
k = 29

samples = np.random.randint(low=-k, high=k+1, size=num_samples)

np.mean((samples - samples.mean())**2)
```
