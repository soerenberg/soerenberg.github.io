# Exercise 2.6

Suppose that we independently roll two standard six-sided dice. Let $X_1$ be the number that shows on the first die, $X_2$ the number on the second die, and $X$ the sum of the numbers on the two dice.

(a) What is $E[X | X_1 \text{ is even}]$?

**Solution:** By linearity

$$
E[X | X_1 \text{ is even}] = E[X_1 | X_1 \text{ is even}] + E[X_2 | X_1 \text{ is even}]
= \frac{2+4+6}{3} + \frac{7}{2} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5.
$$

Intuitively, this makes sense since we expect this expectation value to be slightly larger than $E[X] = 7$ since the even numbers are larger on average than the odd numbers on a standard die.

(b) What is $E[X | X_1 = X_2]$?

Note that if $X_1 = X_2$ then $X$ is even. Thus,

$$
E[X | X_1 = X_2] = \sum_{i=2}^{12} i \cdot P(X=i | X_1 = X_2) = \frac{2+4+\dots+12}{6} = 7.
$$

Here we used that $P(X=i | X_1 = X_2) = 1/6$ for even $i$.

(c) What is $E[X_1 | X=9]$?

If $X=9$ then there are the only $4$ possible values for $(X_1, X_2)$: $(3,6),(4,5),(5,4),(6,3)$. Thus,

$$
E[X_1 | X=9] = \frac{3 + 4+ 5 + 6}{4} = \frac 9 2 = 4.5.
$$

(d) What is $E[X_1 - X_2 | X=k]$ for $k$ in the range $[2,12]$?

Note that $X_1 - X_2 \in \{-5, 4, \dots, 5\}$ and that $P(X_1-X_2=i | X=k) = P(X_1-X_2= -i | X=k)$ for $i \in \{-5, 4, \dots, 5\}$. Therefore, we have

$$
E[X_1 - X_2 | X=k] = \sum_{i=-5}^5 i \cdot P(X_1-X_2=i | X=k) = 0.
$$
