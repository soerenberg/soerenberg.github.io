# Exercise 2.1

Suppose we roll a fair $k$-sided die with the numbers 1 through $k$ on the die's faces. If $X$ is the number that appears, what is $E(X)$?

**Solution:** 

$$
E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^K i \cdot P(X=i) = \sum_{i=1}^K i \frac 1 K = \frac 1 K \frac{K(K+1)}{2} =
\frac{K+1}{2},
$$

by using the Gauss' infamous summation formula.

This is consistent with a $6$ sided die having expectation value of $7/2$.

We can also approximate the expectation value of a $k=117$-sided die, which should be $118/2=59$, by sampling as follows.


```python
num_samples = 100000
k = 117

np.random.randint(low=1, high=k+1, size=num_samples).mean()
```
