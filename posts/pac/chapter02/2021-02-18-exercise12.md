# Exercise 2.12
We draw cards uniformly at random with replacement from a deck of $n$ cards. What is the expected number of cards we must draw until we have seen all $n$ cards in the deck? If we draw $2n$ cards, what is the expected number of cards in the deck that are not chosen at all? Chosen exactly once?

**Solution:** Let $X$ be the random variable of after how many draws we have seen all cards and let
$X_i$, $i=1,\dots,n$, be the number of cards drawn until we see the $i$th unique card. Then we have

$$
X = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i.
$$

$X_i$, $i=1,\dots,n$, is geometric distributed with probability of success $p_i := 1 - \frac{i-1}{n}$. Therefore,

$$
\begin{align*}
P(X_i = k) &=  (1 - p_i)^{k-1} p_i,\\
P(X_i \geq k) &=  (1 - p_i)^{k-1}.
\end{align*}
$$

Recall that the expectation value of a geometric distributed random variable can be calculated by

$$
E[X_i] = \sum_{k=1}^\infty P(X_i \geq k) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1 - p_i)^{k-1} = \frac{1}{1-(1-p_i)} = \frac{1}{p_i}.
$$

Therefore,

$$
E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i] = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{p_i} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{1 - \frac{i-1}{n}}
= n \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{n-i+1} = n \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} = n \cdot H(n),
$$

where $H(n)$ denotes the $n$th harmonic number.

In particular, for a $n=52$ card deck we get

$$
E[X] = 52 \sum_{i=1}^{52} \frac{1}{i} = 235.978\dots.
$$


We can verify this by a simple (but inefficient) simulation with the following code.


```python
n = 52
num_samples = 10000

m = 20*n  # max. drawn per experiment


def calculate_rv_X(a, n):
    for i in range(1, len(a)+1):
        if len(set(a[:i])) == n:
            return i
    raise RuntimeError("Draws exceeded. Try again or increase m.")
    
samples = np.random.randint(low=0, high=n, size=(num_samples, m))

sim_X = np.array([calculate_rv_X(s, n) for s in samples])
sim_X.mean()
```
